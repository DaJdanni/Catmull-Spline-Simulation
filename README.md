# Catmull-Spline-Simulation
A functional simulation that represents the math behind catmull splines    
Use **LEFT CLICK** to add a *point*    
Use **RIGHT CLICK** to *connect points with segments*    
Use **MIDDLE CLICK** to *clear the screen*  
**NOTE:** *There are some minor bugs I could fix and optimizations I could create but the simulation works pretty well for a first version...*
